Steps to Implement the Project
Data Collection and Preprocessing

Load the MNIST dataset (available via libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch).
Normalize the pixel values (scale them to a range of 0-1).
Reshape the data if necessary (for example, converting 2D images to 1D arrays).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize some samples of the digits.
Analyze the distribution of classes (digits 0-9) to ensure balanced classes.
Model Selection

Choose an appropriate machine learning model. Common choices include:
Logistic Regression: Simple and interpretable.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional spaces.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Often the best performance for image data.
Model Training

Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the selected model on the training set.
Use techniques like cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Visualize misclassified images to understand where the model struggles.
Model Improvement

Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and techniques (e.g., data augmentation, dropout for regularization).
Consider using ensemble methods or transfer learning.
Deployment

Create a simple web application or a command-line interface for users to upload images and get predictions.
Use frameworks like Flask or Django for web applications.
