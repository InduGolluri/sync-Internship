##Hey, it's Hindhu, your 2nd-year BTech friend! Welcome to github. Let's play and learn together!


Project Overview
Objective
The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) into their respective categories.

Dataset
MNIST Dataset: The most commonly used dataset for this task, containing 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). Each image is 28x28 pixels.


Handwritten digit recognition is an excellent way to apply machine learning and understand deep learning concepts. This project not only enhances your coding skills but also provides insights into data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques.
